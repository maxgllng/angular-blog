Cause I can see it in your eyes
You wonder why
I didn't wanna shut you out
But I was bleeding every time
You came around

Of all of the things I've said and done
I still remember
Every single dream
It's fading to whatever
But all of my demons helped me out
Said 'you don't need it
Cause you're not that weak
And nothing lasts forever`,
